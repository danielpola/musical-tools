Simple script to transform all wav files within a directory (and it subdirectories) to MP3 using LAME.
    
Call the script with the argument --folder to give an specific folder, or use default the folder 'inputs'
at the same level than this script.

It skips files if a mp3 version already exists. (Same name but with .mp3 instead of .wav)
